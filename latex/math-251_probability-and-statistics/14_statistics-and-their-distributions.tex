\section*{Statistics and their Distributions}
The random variables \( X_{1},X_{2},\dots,X_{n} \) are said to form a random
sample of size \( n \) if the following conditions are satisfied.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Every \( X_{i} \) has the same probability distribution.
  \item The random variable \( X_{1},X_{2},\dots,X_{n} \) are independent.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Example}
Using the populuation of graduating RIT students, select a person from the
population and observe his or her GPA. Then, with/without replacement (the
population size is big and \( n \) is not big compared to the population
size) select a student and then observe his or her GPA. Repeat \( n \)
times. We consider \( n \) random variables where \( X_{1} \) is the GPA of
the first selected person, \( X_{2} \) is the GPA of the second selected
person, and so on. Then \( X_{1},X_{2},\dots,X_{n} \) for a random sample of
size \( n \). Once we finish the n\textsuperscript{th} observation, we
have \( n \) numbers:
\[ x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n} \]
We can consider the sample mean, median, variance, fourth spread, etc as
functions. Consider the case \( n = 3 \).
\[ (2.9,3.0,3.8)\to3.233\dots \]
\[ (2.5,3.7,3.9)\to3.466\dots \]
\( \overline{X} \) is a statistic and random variable that takes a sample as
input and outputs a number. Sample mean, sample median, sample variance, et
cetera can be viewed as random variables. Each of them is called a
statistic. The probability distribution of \( X_{1},X_{2},\dots,X_{n} \) is
also called population distribution.

\subsection*{Example}
A certain brand of MP3 player comes in three configurations: a model with 2GB
of memory, costing \$80, a 4GB model priced at \$100, and an 8GB version with
a price tag of \$120. If 20\% of all purchasers choose the 2GB model, 30\%
choose the 4GB model, then the probability distribution of the cost \( X \) of
a single randomly selected MP3 player purchase is given by:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    \( x \) & 80 & 100 & 120 \\
    \hline
    \( p(x) \) & 0.2 & 0.3 & 0.5 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{align*}
  p(80) &= p(X=80) = 0.2 \\
  \mu &= 106 \\
  \sigma^{2} &= 244
\end{align*}
Suppose on a particular day, only two MP3 players are sold. Let \( X_{1} \) be
the random variable representing the revenue of the first sale, and \( X_{2} \)
be the random variable representing the revenue of the second sale. \( X_{1} \)
and \( X_{2} \) are independent and their pmf is \( p(x) \). \( X_{1} \) and
\( X_{2} \) form a random sample of size 2.
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    \( x_{1} \) & \( x_{2} \) & \( p(x_{1},x_{2}) \) & \( \overline{x} \) &
      \( \sigma^{2} \) \\
    \hline
    80 & 80 & 0.04 & 80 & 0 \\
    \hline
    80 & 100 & 0.06 & 90 & 200 \\
    \hline
    80 & 120 & \( 0.2\times0.5 \) & 100 & 800 \\
    \hline
    100 & 80 & 0.06 & 90 & 200 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
