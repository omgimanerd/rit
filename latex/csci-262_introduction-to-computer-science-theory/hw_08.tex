For each of the following problems, determine if the language is regular or
not. If it is regular, provide an FA (state transition diagram), NFA (state
transition diagram), or RE for it. If it is not regular, prove it via the
pumping lemma. (5 points each). All strings are over \( \{a,b\} \).
\begin{itemize}
  \item The set of all strings of odd length where the middle character is b.
  \par
  Let this language be \( L \) and assume that it is regular. By the pumping
  lemma, there exists \( p\in\N \) such that for all \( s\in L \) such that
  \( |s|\ge p \) there exist \( x,y,z \) such that \( s = xyz, |xy|\le p, |y|>0
  \), and \( \forall{i}\ge0(xy^iz\le L) \). \par
  Let \( s = a^pb^{2p+1}a^p \). Let \( x,y,z \) be such that
  \( s = xyz, |xy|\le p, |y|>0 \) and for all \( i\ge0, xy^iz\in L \). \par
  Let \( i = 2 \). By the pumping lemma, \( xy^2z\in L \). But \( xy^2z =
  abba \). This is a contradiction and thus \( L \) is not regular.
  \item The set of all strings of the form \( xyz \), where \( |y|>0 \).
  (\( x \),\( y \), and \( z \) may be different characters for each string).
  \[ (a\cup b)^*(a\cup b)^+(a\cup b)^* \]
  \item The set of all strings where the number of \( a \)'s is divisible by
  the number of \( b \)'s.
  \item The set of all strings where the number of \( a \)'s is a power of 2.
  \item The set of all strings with exactly 2 more \( a \)'s than \( b \)'s.
