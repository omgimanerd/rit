For each of the following problems, determine if the language is regular or
not. If it is regular, provide an FA (state transition diagram), NFA (state
transition diagram), or RE for it. If it is not regular, prove it via the
pumping lemma. (5 points each). All strings are over \( \{a,b\} \).
\begin{itemize}
  \item The set of all strings of odd length where the middle character is b.
  \par
  Let this language be \( L \) and assume that it is regular. By the pumping
  lemma, there exists \( p\in\N \) such that for all \( s\in L \) such that
  \( |s|\ge p \) there exist \( x,y,z \) such that \( s = xyz, |xy|\le p, |y|>0
  \), and \( \forall{i}\ge0(xy^iz\in L) \). \par
  Let \( s = ab^{2p+1}a \). Let \( x,y,z \) be such that
  \( s = xyz, |xy|\le p, |y|>0 \) and for all \( i\ge0, xy^iz\in L \). Since
  \( |xy|\le p \), the string \( y \) must consist of one or more \( b \)'s.
  \par
  Let \( i = 2 \). By the pumping lemma, \( xy^2z\in L \). But \( xy^2z =
  ab^{2p+1-c}b^{2c}a \) for all \( c>0 \). Since this can result in even length
  strings which are clearly not in the language \( L \), this results in a
  contradiction and thus the language \( L \) is not regular.

  \item The set of all strings of the form \( xyz \), where \( |y|>0 \).
  (\( x \),\( y \), and \( z \) may be different characters for each string).
  \[ (a\cup b)^+ \]
  This language is regular.

  \item The set of all strings where the number of \( a \)'s is divisible by
  the number of \( b \)'s.
  Let this language be \( L \) and assume that it is regular. By the pumping
  lemma, there exists \( p\in\N \) such that for all \( s\in L \) such that
  \( |s|\ge p \) there exist \( x,y,z \) such that \( s = xyz, |xy|\le p, |y|>0
  \), and \( \forall{i}\ge0(xy^iz\in L) \). \par
  Let \( s = a^pb^{kp} \). Let \( x,y,z \) be such that
  \( s = xyz, |xy|\le p, |y|>0 \) and for all \( i\ge0, xy^iz\in L \). Since
  \( |xy|\le p \), the string \( xy \) must consist of all \( a \)'s, and thus
  the string \( y \) must consist of all \( a \)'s.
  \par
  Let \( i = 2 \). By the pumping lemma, \( xy^2z\in L \). But \( xy^2z =
  a^{p-c}a^{2c}b^{2kp} \) where \( 0<c\le p \). In order for \( xy^2z\in L \) to
  be true, \( p-c+2c = 2kp \) must be true for all \( c \) such that
  \( 0<c\le p \). It follows that \( xy^2z\notin L \). This is a contradiction,
  thus \( L \) is not a regular language.

  \item The set of all strings where the number of \( a \)'s is a power of 2.
  Let this language be \( L \) and assume that it is regular. By the pumping
  lemma, there exists \( p\in\N \) such that for all \( s\in L \) such that
  \( |s|\ge p \) there exist \( x,y,z \) such that \( s = xyz, |xy|\le p, |y|>0
  \), and \( \forall{i}\ge0(xy^iz\in L) \). \par
  Let \( s = a^{2^p} \). Let \( x,y,z \) be such that
  \( s = xyz, |xy|\le p, |y|>0 \) and for all \( i\ge0, xy^iz\in L \). It
  follows that the string \( y \) must consist of all \( a \)'s. \par
  Let \( i = 2 \). By the pumping lemma, \( xy^2z\in L \). Since \( |y|>0 \) and
  \( |xy^2z|>2^p \), it follows that \( |xy^2z| = 2^p+c \) where \( 0<c\le p \).
  By the definition of \( L \), \( xy^2z\notin L \). This is a contradiction,
  therefore the language \( L \) is not a regular language.

  \item The set of all strings with exactly 2 more \( a \)'s than \( b \)'s.
  Let this language be \( L \) and assume that it is regular. By the pumping
  lemma, there exists \( p\in\N \) such that for all \( s\in L \) such that
  \( |s|\ge p \) there exist \( x,y,z \) such that \( s = xyz, |xy|\le p, |y|>0
  \), and \( \forall{i}\ge0(xy^iz\in L) \). \par
  Let \( s = a^{p+2}b^{p} \). Let \( x,y,z \) be such that
  \( s = xyz, |xy|\le p, |y|>0 \) and for all \( i\ge0, xy^iz\in L \). Since
  \( |y|>0 \) and \( |xy|\le p \), it follows that \( xy \) must be a string of
  all \( a \)'s and thus \( y \) is a string of only \( a \)'s. \par
  Let \( i = 2 \). By the pumping lemma, \( xy^2z\in L \). But \( xy^2z =
  a^{2+p-c}a^{2c}b^{p} = a^{2+p+c}b^{p} \) where \( 0<c\le p \). By the
  definition of \( L \), \( xy^2z\notin L \). This is a contradiction and thus
  the language \( L \) is not a regular language.
