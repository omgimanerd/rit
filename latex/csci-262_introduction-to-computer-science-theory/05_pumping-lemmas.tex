\section*{Pumping Lemmas}
A general criteria for establishing non-regularity: If \( A \) is a regular
language, then there is an integer \( p \) such that for any \( s\in A \) with
\( |s|\ge p \) there are strings \( x,y,z \) such \( s = xyz \) and:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item for any \( i\ge0, xy^iz\in A \)
  \item \( |y| > 0 \)
  \item \( |xy|\le p \)
\end{enumerate}
This is called a pumping lemma because you repeat or pump the substring \( y \).

\subsection*{Using the pumping lemma}
The language \( L = \{a^jb^{2j}\mid j\ge 0\} \) is not regular. To prove this,
suppose for a contradiction that \( L \) is regular. Then by the pumping lemma,
let \( p \) be the integer such that every string \( s \) in \( L \) with
\( |s|\ge p \) can be written as \( xyz \), where \( |xy|\le p, |y| > 0 \), and
\( xy^iz\in L \) for all \( i\ge0 \).
\begin{itemize}
  \item Let \( s = a^pb^{2p} \). Then \( s\in L \) and \( |s|\ge p \). So, there
  exist strings \( x,y,z \) such that \( s = xyz, |xy|\le p, |y| > 0 \), and
  \( xy^iz\in L \) for all \( i\ge0 \).
  \item In particular, \( xz\in L \) (choosing \( i = 0 \))
  \item Since \( |xy|\le p \) and \( |y| > 0 \), \( y \) consists of 1 or more
  \( a \)'s. If we remove \( y \) from \( a^pb^{2p} \), we get a string with
  \( 2p~b \)'s and less than \( p~a \)'s.
  \item \( xz \) has \( 2p~b \)'s and less than \( p~a \)'s. But then, by the
  definition of \( L \), \( xz\notin L \). This is a contradiction.
  \item It follows that the assumption that \( L \) is regular is wrong.
  \item So, we have shown that \( L \) is not regular.
