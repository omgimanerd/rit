\section*{Regular Languages and Regular Expressions}
A \textbf{regular expression} over \( \Sigma \) is a description of a language
that can be built from \( \emptyset,\{\epsilon\},\{a\} \) for \( a\in\Sigma \),
using operators, union, concatenation, and Kleene star. For example, the
following language over \( \{a,b\} \) is described by a regular expression:
\[ (\{a\}\cup\{b\})^*\circ\{a\}\circ\{a\}\circ(\{a\}\cup\{b\})^*\cup
  (\{a\}\cup\{b\})^*\circ\{b\}\circ\{b\}\circ(\{a\}\cup\{b\})^* \]
This can be written a bit more concisely as:
\[ (\{a\}\cup\{b\})^*aa(\{a\}\cup\{b\})^*\cup
  (\{a\}\cup\{b\})^*bb(\{a\}\cup\{b\})^* \]

\subsubsection*{Example}
Given regular expressions to describe:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The language of strings over \( \{a,b\} \) of even length.
  \[ (aa\cup ab\cup ba\cup bb)^* \]
  \[ ((a\cup b)(a\cup b))^* \]
  \item The language of strings over \( \{a,b,c\} \) in which all \( s \)'s
  precede all \( b \)'s and \( c \)'s, and all \( b \)'s precede all \( c \)'s.
  \[ a^*b^*c^* \]
  \item The language of strings over \( \{0,1\} \) with length greater than
  three.
  \[ (0\cup1)(0\cup1)(0\cup1)(0\cup1)(0\cup1)^* \]
  \[ (0\cup1)^4(0\cup1)^* \]
  \item The language of strings of odd length of \( \{a,b\} \) that contain
  the substring \( \{ bb \} \).
  \[ ((a\cup b)^2)^*(abb\cup bba \cup bbb)((a\cup b)^2)^* \]
  \item The language of strings of \( \{0,1\} \) that do not contain the
  substring \( 000 \).
\end{itemize}
Is \( \{a^ib^i \mid i\in\N \} \)?
