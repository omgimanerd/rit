\section*{Linear Algebra}
To define a plane, we need a point on the plane and a normal vector, or two
vectors on the plane.
\[ \vec{n}\cdot(\vec{x}-\vec{p}) = 0 \]
This is the point normal form of a plane (where \( \vec{n} \) is the normal
vector, \( \vec{p} \) is the point, and \( \vec{x} \) is a vector on the plane).
If instead we are given a point \( \vec{p} \) and two vectors \( \vec{u} \) and
\( \vec{v} \), we can describe any point in the plane as a linear combination of
\( \vec{u} \) and \( \vec{v} \).
\[ s\vec{u}+t\vec{v} = \vec{x}-\vec{p} \]
This is the vector form of a plane.

\subsubsection*{Example}
Find the equation of the plane that contains \( (6,0,1) \) and has normal vector
\( \vec{n} = \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 2 \\ 3\end{bmatrix} \).
\begin{align*}
  \langle1,2,3\rangle\cdot(\langle x,y,z\rangle-\langle6,0,1\rangle) &= 0 \\
  \langle1,2,3\rangle\cdot\langle x-6,y-0,z-1\rangle &= 0 \\
  1(x-6)+2y+3(z-1) &= 0 \\
  x-6+2y+3z-3 &= 0 \\
  x+2y+3z &= 9
\end{align*}
Knowing \( \vec{p} = \langle6,0,1\rangle \) is on the plane, find the vector
form. To do this, we need to find two other points \( Q \) and \( R \) in the
plane. We can pick these arbitrarily by plugging them into the equation.
\begin{align*}
  Q &= (9,0,0) \\
  R &= (3,3,0)
\end{align*}
We can then construct the vectors \( \vec{u} \) and \( \vec{v} \) by calculating
the vector between Q and the point represented by \( \vec{p} \), and analogously
for point R.
\begin{align*}
  \vec{u} &= \overrightarrow{QP} = \langle9,0,0\rangle-\langle6,0,1\rangle =
    \langle3,0,-1\rangle \\
  \vec{v} &= \overrightarrow{RP} = \langle3,3,0\rangle-\langle6,0,1\rangle =
    \langle-3,3,-1\rangle
\end{align*}
These two vectors can then construct the vector form of the plane.
\begin{align*}
  \begin{bmatrix}x \\ y \\ z\end{bmatrix} &=
    \begin{bmatrix} 6 \\ 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}+
    s\begin{bmatrix}3 \\ 0 \\ -1\end{bmatrix}+
    t\begin{bmatrix}-3 \\ 3 \\ -1\end{bmatrix} \\
  x &= 6+3s-3t \\
  y &= 3t \\
  z &= 1-s-t
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Systems of Linear Equations}
For two lines in \( \R^2 \), two lines can either intersect at a single point,
infinitely many points if they lie on top of each other, or no points if they
are parallel.
\begin{align*}
  x-y &= 1 \\
  x+y &= 3
\end{align*}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw[thick,<->] (-5,0) -- (5,0);
    \draw[thick,<->] (0,-5) -- (0,5);
    \draw[red] (-2,-3) -- (3,2);
    \draw[red] (-2,5) -- (3,0);
    \draw[fill=black] (2,1) circle (0.1cm);
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
These are two lines that intersect with a unique solution at \( (3,1) \). As
counterexamples:
\begin{align*}
  x-y &= 2 \\
  2x-2y &= 4
\end{align*}
These two lines lie on top of each other, resulting in infinitely many
solutions.
\begin{align*}
  x-y &= 1 \\
  x-y &= 3
\end{align*}
These two lines are parallel, and have no solutions.

\subsection*{Gaussian Elimination}
We can use Gaussian Elimination to solve systems of linear equations.
\begin{align*}
  x-y-z &= 2 \\
  3x-3y+2x &= 16 \\
  2x-y+z &= 9
\end{align*}
We can compose these equations into an augmented matrix.
\[ \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & -1 & -1 & 2 \\
  3 & -3 & 2 & 16 \\
  2 & -1 & 1 & 9
\end{bmatrix} \]
The goal is acquire an upper triangular matrix. First perform \( R_2-3R_1 \)
and replace \( R_2 \) with the result.
\[ \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & -1 & -1 & 2 \\
  0 & 0 & 5 & 10 \\
  2 & -1 & 1 & 9
\end{bmatrix} \]
Then we perform \( R_3-2R_1 \) and replace \( R_3 \) with the result.
\[ \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & -1 & -1 & 2 \\
  0 & 0 & 5 & 10 \\
  0 & 1 & 3 & 5
\end{bmatrix} \]
We can now swap \( R_2 \) and \( R_3 \).
\[ \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & -1 & -1 & 2 \\
  0 & 1 & 3 & 5 \\
  0 & 0 & 5 & 10
\end{bmatrix} \]
This matrix is now in row echelon form, where the leading entry in any row has
zeroes below it. From this point, we can perform back substitution to get back
a system of equations:
\begin{align*}
  5z &= 10 \quad z = 2 \\
  y+3z &= 5 \quad y+6 = 5 \quad y = -1 \\
  x-y-z &= 2 \quad x = 2+(-1)+(2) = 3 \\
  (x,y,z) &= (3,-1,2)
\end{align*}

\subsubsection*{Example}
Here is an example of a system of linear equations with 3 equations and 3
unknowns that has no solution.
\begin{align*}
  x_1-x_2+2x_3 &= 3 \\
  x_1+2x_2-x_3 &= -3 \\
  2x_2-2x_3 &= 1
\end{align*}
First we form it into an augmented matrix.
\[ \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & -1 & 2 & 3 \\
  1 & 2 & -1 & -3 \\
  0 & 2 & -2 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \]
For our first row reduction, we will pivot off the first row by subtracting it
from the second row.
\[ \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & -1 & 2 & 3 \\
  0 & 3 & -3 & -6 \\
  0 & 2 & -2 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \]
For simplicity, we will divide the second row by 3.
\[ \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & -1 & 2 & 3 \\
  0 & 1 & -1 & -2 \\
  0 & 2 & -2 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \]
Our goal is to obtain an upper triangular matrix, so we can try performing
\( R_3-2R_1 \) and placing it back in \( R_3 \).
\[ \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & -1 & 2 & 3 \\
  0 & 1 & -1 & -2 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 5
\end{bmatrix} \]
With the matrix in row-echelon form, we can conclude that there is no solution,
because our third row will translate to \( 0x_1+0x_2+0x_3 = 5 \). This system
of linear equations is inconsistent. \par
If we rewrite the system of linear equations as an equation with matrices, we
can reintroduce some ideas.
\begin{align*}
  A\vec{x} &= \vec{b} \\
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & -1 & 2 \\
    1 & 2 & -1 \\
    0 & 2 & -2
  \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
    x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3
  \end{bmatrix} &= \begin{bmatrix}
    3 \\ -3 \\ 1
  \end{bmatrix} \\
  x_1\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}+
    x_2\begin{bmatrix}-1 \\ 2 \\ 2\end{bmatrix}+
    x_3\begin{bmatrix}2 \\ -1 \\ -2\end{bmatrix} &=
  \begin{bmatrix}3 \\ -3 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
The right hand side of the equation cannot be expressed as a linear combination
of the columns of \( A \). In general, \(
span\{\vec{v_1},\vec{v_2},\dots,\vec{v_k} \) is the set of all linear
combinations \( c_1\vec{v_1}+c_2\vec{v_2}+\dots+c_k\vec{v_k} \). In this
example, the right hand side is not in the span of the column vectors.

\subsubsection*{Example}
Here is an example of 3 equations with 4 unknowns that have infinite solutions.
\begin{align*}
  w-x-y+2x &= 1 \\
  2x-2x-y+3z &= 3 \\
  -w+x-y &= -3
\end{align*}
Again, we form it into an augmented matrix.
\[ \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & -1 & -1 & 2 & 1 \\
  2 & -2 & -1 & 3 & 3 \\
  -1 & 1 & -1 & 0 & -3
\end{bmatrix} \]
Pivoting off the first row, we will perform \( R_2-2R_1 \) and replace \( R_2 \)
with the result. We will then perform \( R_3+R_1 \) and replace \( R_3 \) with
the result.
\[ \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & -1 & -1 & 2 & 1 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 1 \\
  0 & 0 & -2 & 2 & -2
\end{bmatrix} \]
We can now attempt to pivot off the second row and perform \( R_3+2R_2 \),
replacing \( R_3 \) with the result.
\[ \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & -1 & -1 & 2 & 1 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 1 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix} \]
This matrix is now in row-echelon form. We can go one step further and put it
into reduced row-echelon form. We can do this by performing \( R_1+R_2 \) and
replacing \( R_1 \) with the result.
\[ \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 1 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix} \]
In terms of equations, this matrix tells us the following:
\begin{align*}
  w-x+z &= 2 \\
  y-z &= 1
\end{align*}
Two equations is only enough to constrain two variables, which means we have two
unconstrained variables. If we arbitrarily pick \( w \) and \( y \) as our
constrained variables, we can rewrite our equations in terms of our free
variables.
\begin{align*}
  x &= s \quad z = t \\
  \begin{bmatrix}w \\ x \\ y \\ z\end{bmatrix} &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
      2+s-t \\
      s \\
      1+t \\
      t
    \end{bmatrix} \quad -\infty<s,t<\infty \\
\end{align*}
Going further, we can rewrite our solution space into a parameterized matrix
equation.
\[ \begin{bmatrix}w \\ x \\ y \\ z\end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix}2 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}+
  s\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}+
  t\begin{bmatrix}-1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 1\end{bmatrix} \]
We can see from this parameterization that our solution space is a two parameter
infinite set spanned by two vectors in \( \R^4 \). Our coefficient matrix
\( A \) was a \( 3\times4 \) matrix. We can compute the rank of \( A \) by
counting the number of nonzero rows in its reduced row-echelon form, which is
2. The rank is analogous to the number of constrained equations that we have,
which is also equal to the number of constrained variables. \par

\subsubsection*{Rank-Nullity Theorem}
If \( n \) is the number of variables in the system (also the number of columns
in \( A \)), it is equal to the sum of the rank of \( A \) (constrained
variables) and the number of free variables. The number of free variables is
also known as the nullity of \( A \).

\subsubsection*{Null Space}
The null space of \( A \) is the subspace of \( \R^n \) consisting of solutions
to \( A\vec{x} = \vec{0} \) and is denoted by \( null(A) \). To compute the
null space of the above problem, we can replace \( \vec{b} \) with \( \vec{0} \)
and compute the reduced row-echelon form. This comes out to be
\[ \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix} \]
We can rewrite this into a parameterized matrix equation.
\[ \begin{bmatrix}w \\ x \\ y \\ z\end{bmatrix} =
  s\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}+
  t\begin{bmatrix}-1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 1\end{bmatrix} \]
This comes out to the same form as our solution space. Our null space is just
the span of the two vectors in \( \R^4 \).
