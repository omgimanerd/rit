\subsection*{Identify some instance of bullshit and write 1 page on why it
is bullshit.}

\textbf{Premise:} Religion, as a whole, is bullshit. For the purposes of this
argument, I will discuss this premise from the frameworks of the monotheistic
Abrahamic religions. \\

In class, we discussed how a person could be bullshitting regardless of the
truth of his/her words. The amount of bullshit in a person's words is irrelevant
to the truth of his statement, but rather their relation to those words, their
relation to their audience, and their intent in their delivery. A bullshitter
by definition seeks to promote some agenda through a manipulation of the
way they are perceived. \\
There is no better example for this than religion itself. Over the past few
millenia, religion has emerged as a dominant force in society, imposing rules
and guidelines on a person's behavior and mindset. Religion came about as a
Stone Age method of social structure and control, and thus its agenda has
always been establishing social control. \\
Like bullshit, religion is wholly unconcerned with the facts, or lack
thereof, in their dogma. With the exception of a small portion of the devout,
few religious people believe in the literal truth of their religious dogma.
Religious scripture very easily falls apart under any scrutiny. \\
Since we have established that religion is unconcerned with truth, what about
morality? Many profess that religious doctrines and texts are meant to be read
metaphorically. Well, like bullshit, even if religion professes to be an upstanding source of metaphorical objective morality, it still has an agenda
unrelated to what its moral strictures are conveying. As in the case of the
monotheistic Abrahamic religions, one can very easily find elements of the ``us
vs. them'', ``my god is the only god'' mentality.
