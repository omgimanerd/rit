\begin{itemize}
  \item Joey was spying on the party but his actions could have saved someone's
    life. Do the good Samaritan rules apply? Does this make it more ethical?
  \item What is the severity of the punishment? Does the intent of the hacking
    matter?
  \item Does a mother spying on her kids go under a different set of rules? Do
    parents have a right to spy on their kids for the purpose of safety?
\end{itemize}
