\section*{Cryptography}
Desired security properties in the digital world:
\begin{itemize}
  \item confidentiality, secrecy
  \item data integrity
  \item authentication, of data origin and entity
  \item non-repudiation
\end{itemize}
Cryptography is an important, but only a relatively small part of security:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the right choice of tools is hard
  \item implementation errors are common
  \item a variety of side-channel attacks can bypass the best cryptography
  \item social engineering
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Unkeyed, Symmetric-Key, and Public-Key}
Primitives, algorithms, and protocols can be \textbf{unkeyed},
\textbf{symmetric-key}, or \textbf{public-key}.

\subsubsection*{Unkeyed}
This includes hashing and the SHA-family of algorithms. It can be used for
signing and the generation of random sequences.
