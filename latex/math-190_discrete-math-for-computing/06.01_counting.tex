\section*{Counting}
Counting is a higher level math topic involving subtle counting rules,
applying logic, and set theory. It involves questions such as:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item How many license plates have the form AAA-DDDD where A is an uppercase
    alphabetical character and D is a digit?
  \item Jessica, Tim, Dan, and Mary are lining up to purchase tickets at a
    movie theater. In how many ways can they line up?
  \item Two people from a group of 10 are being selected to co-chair an
    upcoming event. How many ways are there to select 2 people from 10?
  \item In a binary string of length 5, how many strings contain exactly two
    1's somewhere in the string?
  \item 75 students are enrolled in math or english. If 40 students are
    enrolled in math and 50 students are enrolled in english then how many
    students are enrolled in both?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Tree Diagrams}
A \textbf{tree diagram} is a useful visual tool for enumerating outcomes. For
example, suppose we wish to list all of the outcomes from rolling a die and
then flipping a coin. The tree diagram begins at a point and then splits into
6 directions. Then each branches off into 2 directions from flipping a coin.

      [5 [H] [T]]
      [6 [H] [T]]
    ]

\subsection*{Product Rule}
In a string of length \( k \), if there are \( n_{1} \) ways to fill position
1, \( n_{2} \) ways to fill position 2, \( \dots \) and \( n_{k} \) ways to
fill position \( k \) then there are \( n_{1}\cdot n_{2}\cdot\dots\cdot n_{k} \)
strings altogether.

\subsection*{Addition Rule}
If a set \( S \) can be divided up into \( k \) non-overlapping subsets
\( T_{1},T_{2},\dots,T_{k} \) then \( |S| = |T_{1}|+|T_{2}|+\dots+|T_{k}| \).

\subsection*{Opposite Rule}
Suppose \( S \) consists of a set of objects chosen from a larger universe of
objects \( \U \). Then \( |S| = |\U|-|\overline{S}| \).
