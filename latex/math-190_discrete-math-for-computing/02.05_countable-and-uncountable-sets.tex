\section*{Countable and Uncountable Sets}
Recall for a set \( S \), \( |S| \) is the cardinality of \( S \), If \( S \)
has a finite number of objects, then \( |S|\in N \). Consider the following
six sets:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \( E \) is the set of positive even numbers less than or equal
    to 100.
  \item \( \Z \) is the set of all integers.
  \item \( U \) is the set of all real numbers between 0 and 1.
  \item \( P \) is the set of all prime numbers less than or equal to
    50.
  \item \( \Q \) is the set of all rational numbers.
  \item \( \R \) is the set of all real numbers.
\end{itemize}
Both \( E \) and \( P \) are finite sets with \( |E| = 50 \) and \( |P| = 15 \).
The remaining four sets are all infinite.

\subsection*{Infinite Sets}
Two sets \( A \) and \( B \) have the same \textbf{cardinality}, written
\( A\sim B \), if there is a bijection between them.
Let \( A \) be a set:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \( A \) is \textbf{countable} if it is finite: \( A \sim \Z^{+} \)
  \item \( A \) is \textbf{countably infinite} if \( A \sim \Z^{+} \)
  \item \( A \) is \textbf{uncountable} if it is not countable.
\end{itemize}
