\section*{Work-Energy Theorem}
\[ \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \text{kinetic energy in joules} \]

\subsection*{Constant Force with a Varying Direction of Motion}
An iceboat is tethered by a rope to a post so that it can move around an arc of
a circle of radius \( R = 100.0m \). The wind exerts a constant force \( F =
150N \) on the boat. What is the work done by the wind on the boat as it rotates
through \( 90.0^{\circ} \)?
\begin{align*}
  W &= \int\vec{F}\cdot\diff{\vec{s}} \\
  &= \int F\diff{s}\cos(\theta) \\
  &= F\int\cos(\theta)\diff{s} \\
  &= F\int\cos(\theta)r\diff{\theta} \\
  &= Fr\int_{0}^{90}\cos(\theta)\diff{\theta} \\
  &= (150N)(100)(\sin(90)-\sin(0)) \\
  &= 15000J
\end{align*}
If the boat starts from rest, what is its speed at the end of this motion
(again, friction is negligible)?
\begin{align*}
  W &= \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2-\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2 \\
  15000J &= \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2-\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2 \\
  v_f &= \sqrt{\frac{30000J}{m}}
\end{align*}
The mass of the iceboat is the same as the problems from the Activities Manual
(250kg).
\[ v_f \approx 11\frac{m}{s} \]
