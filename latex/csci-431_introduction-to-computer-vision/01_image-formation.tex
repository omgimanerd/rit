\section*{Image Formation}
Physical parameters of image formation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Optical: focal length, field of view, aperture
  \item Geometric: types of Oprojection
  \item Photometric: type, direction, intensity of light reaching the sensor
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{What is an image?}
Until now, an image was defined as a 2D pattern of intensity values. Now, we
interpret it as a 2D projection of 3D points. A camera is a device that allows
for the projection of points from 3D to 2D. In the process of taking a picture,
we preserve things like straight lines and points of incidence, but lose
information such as angles and length. \par
The brightness of an image pixel is determined by the light source, the surface
shape, orientation, and reflectance properties, the optics, exposure, and nature
of the sensor lens.

\subsection*{Types of 3D Projections}
A 3D projection is any method of mapping three-dimensional points to a
two-dimensional plane.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Perspective projections: objects in the distance appear smaller than
    those close by, and parallel lines converge at a image point in infinity, on
    the horizon.
  \item Weak perspective projections: perspective effects, but not over the
    scale of individual objects.
  \item Orthographic projections: objects in the distance appear the same as
    those close by, parallel lengths at all points are of the same scale
    regardless of the distance of the camera.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Vanishing Points}
Each set of parallel lines meets at a different point. Sets of parallel lines on
the same plane lead to collinear vanishing points. This is a good way to spot
faked images since scale and perspective don't work and vanishing points behave
badly.
