\subsubsection*{Question 4}
A family spends \$48,000 a year for living expenses. If prices increase by 2
percent a year for the next three years, what amount will the family need for
their living expenses after three years?
\[ FV = 48000(1+0.02)^3 = 50937.98 \]

\subsubsection*{Question 5}
What would be the yearly earnings for a person with \$8,000 in savings at an
annual interest rate of 2.5 percent?
\[ Interest = 8000 * 0.025 * 1 = 25 \]

\subsubsection*{Question 8}
If you desire to have \$20,000 for a down payment for a house in five years,
what amount would you need to deposit today? Assume that your money will earn
5 percent?
\[ PV = \frac{20000}{(1+0.05)^5} = 15670.52 \]

\subsubsection*{Question 10}
Carla Lopez deposits \$3,200 a year into her retirement account. If these funds
have an average earning of 9 percent over the 40 years until her retirement,
what will be the value of her retirement account?
\[ FV = 3200\frac{(1+0.09)^{40}-1}{0.09} = 1081223.82 \]
