\section*{Normalization}
Normalization is a way to make bad data good by dealing with anomalies.
Anomalies occur when data is inserted, deleted, or updated in an inconsistent
way, causing rows to contain different data formats. This is usually solved
by decomposition. If many rows of a table are going to the same data, we can
decompose the table into two tables. For example, instead of:
\begin{lstlisting}
  Game(1, RDR2, M, \$59.99, RPG)
  Game(18, RDR2, M \$59.99, RPG)
\end{lstlisting}
We can decompose this into two tables and store RDR2 in its own Game table as
a template which we can update to reflect the change across all instances.
\begin{lstlisting}
  Game(RDR2, M \$59.99, RPG)
  GameInstance(18, RDR2)
  GameInstance(1, RDR2)
\end{lstlisting}
Decomposition can be either lossy or lossless, depending on whether or not the
original structure of the data can be recovered. In this case, the decomposition
is lossless since we can obtain the original records by joining the tables on
the game title.

\subsection*{Function Dependencies}
Certain fields can map to other fields. For example, ZIP codes can map to cities
and states. We can make certain attributes in a table dependent on other
attributes. Armstrong's Axioms:
\begin{itemize}
  \item if \( X\supseteq Y \) then \( X\to Y \) is reflexivity
  \item if \( X\to Y \) then \( XZ\to YZ \) is augmentation
  \item if \( X\to Y \) and \( Y\to Z \), then \( X\to Z \) is transitivity
\end{itemize}
We use Armstrong's Axioms to infer all functional dependencies and get the
minimal set of functional dependencies that include all possible attributes.
\begin{itemize}
  \item First normal form: all attributes are atomic.
  \item Second normal form: must be in first normal form, no partial key
    dependencies.
\end{itemize}
