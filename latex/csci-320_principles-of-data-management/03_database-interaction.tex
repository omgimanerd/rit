\section*{Database Interaction}
SQL alone is not enough to interact with a database. It cannot display a GUI
since it has no non-declarative actions. There are a few options:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Embedded SQL
  \item Dynamic SQL: ORM/interface
\end{itemize}
We can connect to a database via a direct connection, Open Database Connection
(ODBC), or Java Database Connection (JDBC). Both ODBC and JDBC add a level of
abstraction by acting as a proxy between the application and the database.
While it may slow things down by adding a layer of complexity, it allows you to
switch between databases seamlessly. The application developer can interface
with the ODBC/JDBC in a database agnostic manner. ODBC started out as a
Windows-specific platform but it has grown to almost every platform. Because
these interfaces cater to the lowest common denominator, they do not support
database-specific functionality and are primarily used for simple databases.

\subsection*{Interacting with Python (sample)}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
import psycopg2

conn_string = "host='reddwarf.cs.rit.edu'" \
              "dbname='db'" \
              "user='user'" \
              "password='pw'"
conn = psycopg2.connect(conn_string)
\end{lstlisting}
When connecting to a server, instead of copying data over the network
connection, it is usually always more efficient to use a server side cursor to
query the data. The server will instead hold a small portion of the database
in memory with the cursor pointing to the first element.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
cursor=conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("select * from car")
for data in cursor:
  print(data)
\end{lstlisting}
