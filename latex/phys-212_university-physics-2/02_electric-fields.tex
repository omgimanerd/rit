\section*{Electric Fields}
We know positive charges feel repulsive forces from other positive charges. If
we take a test charge and place it near an object of interest, how it would
experience a force is the direction of the electric field, also known as the
E-field. We define it as:
\[ \vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F_{\circ}}}{q_{\circ}} \]
where \( \vec{F_{\circ}} \) is the force on the test charge, \( q_{\circ} \)
is the test charge, and \( \vec{E} \) is the electric field from some charge
distribution. Usually, we will represent this in the form:
\[ \vec{F} = q\vec{E} \]
This allows us to calculate the force \( \vec{F} \) for some charge \( q \)
exerted by an external electric field \( \vec{E} \). For a point charge, we
calculate the field with:
\[ \vec{E_{pc}} = \frac{Kq\hat{r}}{r^2} \]
This is the same as Coulomb's Law but is measured in Newtons per Coulomb. This
is due to the fact that there is no second charge from the observation charge.
The field lines point away from positive charges and towards negative charges.
