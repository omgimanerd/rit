\section*{Data and Database Security}
Databases are structured collections of data for use by one or more
applications. They contain relationships between data items and groups of data
items. They can contain sensitive data to be secured and use a query language
to provide a uniform interface to the database. A database management system
(DBMS) is a suite of programs for constructing and maintaining the database.

\subsection*{Relational Databases}
Relational databases consist of rows and columns that hold a particular type of
data. Each row has one column where all values are unique, forming a key for
that row. This enables the creation of multiple tables linked together by a
unique identifier that is present in all tables. A relational query language
allows users to request data in this database to fit a given criteria.
