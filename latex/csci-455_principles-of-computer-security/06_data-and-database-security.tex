\section*{Data and Database Security}
Databases are structured collections of data for use by one or more
applications. They contain relationships between data items and groups of data
items. They can contain sensitive data to be secured and use a query language
to provide a uniform interface to the database. A database management system
(DBMS) is a suite of programs for constructing and maintaining the database.

\subsection*{Relational Databases}
Relational databases consist of rows and columns that hold a particular type of
data. Each row has one column where all values are unique, forming a key for
that row. This enables the creation of multiple tables linked together by a
unique identifier that is present in all tables. A relational query language
allows users to request data in this database to fit a given criteria.

\subsubsection*{Relational Database Elements}
Terminology:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A database is composed of relations/tables/files, which holds
  tuples/rows/records that have attributes/columns/fields.
  \item A primary key uniquely identifies a row and consists of one or more
  column names.
  \item A foreign key links one table to attributes in another.
  \item A view or virtual table shows the result of a query that returns
  selected rows and columns from one or more tables.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Structured Query Language (SQL)}
SQL is a language for data manipulation. At its core, it supports a standard
known as CRUD:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Create data
  \item Read data
  \item Update data
  \item Delete data
\end{itemize}
It also defines the database structure as a data definition language, allowing
for a database structure with tables, views, indexes, unique keys. Database
structures can be created, modified, and deleted. The database schema generates
tables stored in a data dictionary which contains metadata about how the table
should store data.

\subsection*{Security}
Security with data is not merely securing the database. The data, database,
DBMS must be secure along with applications, operation systems, web servers,
and network environments that can access the data.
