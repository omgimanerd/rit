\section*{Covert Channels}
Cryptography is the art of secret writing. Steganography is the art of secret
hiding. Covert channels (metaferography) is the art of secret sending. A
communication channel is covert if it is neither designed nor intended to
transfer information. There are two types of covert channels: timing and
storage. Timing channels can transmit data through CPU usage patterns, rhythm
of TCP requests, etc. Storage channels secretly transmit data through files
read. Digital signatures in asymmetric cryptography systems can be used to
secretly carry information.

\subsection*{In-Class Demo}
A modified TFTP server can be used to secretly transmit information, or
maliciously download files from a client. The behavior of games can other state
machines can be utilized and automated for covert information exchange.
