\section*{Computer Security Basics}
Computer Security revolves around the CIA triad of \textbf{confidentiality},
\textbf{integrity}, and \textbf{availability}.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Confidentiality: the protection of information from unauthorized
    disclosure. Enforced through access controls, cryptography, and resource
    hiding.
  \item Integrity: the protection from unauthorized modification of information.
    This involves data integrity and origin integrity. Prevention mechanisms
    prevent unauthorized access and detection mechanisms report when information
    is no longer trustworthy.
  \item Availability: resources and services are usable and operational during
    a given time period despite attacks or failures.
\end{itemize}
Data can be made 100\% confidential simply by destroying it, but then it is
no longer available. Security involves availability because data must be
available to authorized individuals in order to be secure.

\subsection*{Why is security important?}
In the beginning, there was no external threat. Computer security was not an
issue. Now, nearly all devices are networked and attackers no longer have to
physically be at your computer in order to attack it.

\subsection*{Severity of Cyber Attacks}
According to the US CERT:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 4882 vulnerabilities were reported in 2005, with 79\% launched remotely,
    and 62\% leading to a disruption of service.
  \item 6604 vulnerabilities were reported in 2006, with 85\% launched remotely,
    and 65\% leading to a disruption of service.
\end{itemize}
In December 2006, NASA was forced to block emails with attachments before
shuttle launches out of fear that they would be hacked. Many other large
companies and organizations have also been breached, compromising large amounts
of data.

\subsection*{Security and Privacy}
In 2013, Edward Snowden copied and leaked classified information from the NSA.
His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs run by the NSA in
cooperation with foreign governments and telecommunications agencies. \par
By now, we're all aware of the Equifax breach that exposed the social security
numbers and sensitive information of 143 million Americans. The breach was
discovered on July 29th, but hackers had breached their system from mid-May,
giving them a month to work with all the leaked data.
