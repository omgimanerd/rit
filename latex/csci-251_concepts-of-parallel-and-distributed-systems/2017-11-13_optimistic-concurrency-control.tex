\section*{Optimistic Concurrency Control}
There are three phases for optimistic concurrency control:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Working phase
  \item Validation phase
  \item Update phase
\end{itemize}
The time for the working phase is usually greater than the time for the
validation and update. At any given time, only one transaction can be in
validation and update phase. Several transactions can be in the working phase
at any given time.

\subsection*{Backwards Validation}
For transaction \( T_v \), \( T_v \) must not read objects written by \( T_i \)
such that \( i<v \). We check if \( RS(T_v)\cap WS(T_i) = \emptyset \) for each
\( T_i \) that overlaps with \( T_v \). If this is true, then \( T_v \) passes
the validation test, otherwise it fails the validation and is aborted.

\subsection*{Forward Validation}
If \( T_v \) fails validation:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Abort \( T_v \)
  \item Hold update of \( T_v \) until conflicting transactions finish
  \item Abort all conflicting transactions
\end{enumerate}
