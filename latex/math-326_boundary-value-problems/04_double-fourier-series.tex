\section*{Double Fourier Series}
We will use Double Fourier Series to solve partial differential equations with
multiple independent variables, such as heat transfer through a plate.
\begin{align*}
  f(x,y) = \frac{a_{00}}{4}&+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}
    \bigg[a_{0n}\cos(\frac{n\pi y}{L}+b_{0n}\sin(\frac{n\pi y}{L}))\bigg] \\
  &+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}
    \bigg[a_{m0}\cos(\frac{m\pi x}{K}+c_{m0}\sin(\frac{n\pi x}{K}))\bigg] \\
  &+\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}
    \bigg[a_{mn}\cos(\frac{n\pi y}{L})+b_{mn}\sin(\frac{n\pi y}{L})\bigg]
      \cos(\frac{m\pi x}{K}) \\
  &+\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}
    \bigg[c_{mn}\cos(\frac{n\pi y}{L})+d_{mn}\sin(\frac{n\pi y}{L})\bigg]
      \sin(\frac{m\pi x}{K}) \\
\end{align*}
The coefficients are:
\begin{align*}
  a_{mn} &= \frac{1}{KL}\int_{-L}^{L}\int_{-K}^{K}f(x,y)\cos(\frac{m\pi x}{K})
    \cos(\frac{n\pi y}{L})\diff{x}\diff{y} \\
  b_{mn} &= \frac{1}{KL}\int_{-L}^{L}\int_{-K}^{K}f(x,y)\cos(\frac{m\pi x}{K})
    \sin(\frac{n\pi y}{L})\diff{x}\diff{y} \\
  c_{mn} &= \frac{1}{KL}\int_{-L}^{L}\int_{-K}^{K}f(x,y)\sin(\frac{m\pi x}{K})
    \cos(\frac{n\pi y}{L})\diff{x}\diff{y} \\
  d_{mn} &= \frac{1}{KL}\int_{-L}^{L}\int_{-K}^{K}f(x,y)\sin(\frac{m\pi x}{K})
    \sin(\frac{n\pi y}{L})\diff{x}\diff{y} \\
\end{align*}
A subproblem of this is finding a Fourier series for \( f(x,y) \) over a domain.
To reduce the amount of work, look for signs of symmetry:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \( f(x,y) = f(-x,y) \), even in \( x \)
  \item \( -f(x,y) = (f(-x,y) \), odd in \( x \)
  \item \( f(x,y) = f(x,-y) \), even in \( y \)
  \item \( -f(x,y) = f(x,-y) \), odd in \( y \)
\end{enumerate}
If \( f(x) \) has some symmetry, then some coefficients in the Double Fourier
Series will be zero.

\subsubsection*{Example}
Given the function \( f(x,y) = xy \), evaluate the coefficients for the Double
Fourier Series.
\[ a_{mn} = \frac{1}{KL}\int_{-L}^{L}\int_{-K}^{K}f(x,y)\cos(\frac{m\pi x}{K})
  \cos(\frac{n\pi y}{L})\diff{x}\diff{y} \]
Since \( f(x,y) \) is odd in \( x \) and \( \cos(\frac{m\pi x}{K}) \) is even in
\( x \), the product is odd. Evaluating the integral over the symmetric
interval for \( x \) results in 0.
\[ b_{mn} = \frac{1}{KL}\int_{-L}^{L}\int_{-K}^{K}f(x,y)\cos(\frac{m\pi x}{K})
  \sin(\frac{n\pi y}{L})\diff{x}\diff{y} \]
For the same reason as \( a_{mn} \), the product of the functions integrated
for \( x \) over the symmetric interval is 0.
\[ c_{mn} = \frac{1}{KL}\int_{-L}^{L}\int_{-K}^{K}f(x,y)\sin(\frac{m\pi x}{K})
  \cos(\frac{n\pi y}{L})\diff{x}\diff{y} \]
\( f(x,y) \) is odd in \( y \) and \( \cos(\frac{n\pi y}{L}) \) is even in
\( y \). Their product is odd so the integral in \( y \) over the symmetric
interval is 0.
\[ d_{mn} = \frac{1}{KL}\int_{-L}^{L}\int_{-K}^{K}f(x,y)\sin(\frac{m\pi x}{K})
  \sin(\frac{n\pi y}{L})\diff{x}\diff{y} \]
We cannot conclude this for \( d_{mn} \) because the function products are even
in both \( x \) and \( y \), so we would have to evaluate the integral here.
All the other terms would drop out in the Double Fourier Series.
