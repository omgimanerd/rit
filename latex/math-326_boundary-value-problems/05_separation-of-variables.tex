\section*{Separation of Variables}
We need to know when a partial differential equation is separable. Suppose we
have the function \( u_t = 8u_{xx} \). To test for separability:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Suppose \( u(x,t) = X(x)T(t) \).
  \item We need to substitute this into the partial differential equation.
  \item If you can isolate all instances of the \( x \) independent variable
    on one side and the \( t \) independent variable on the other side of the
    equation, then the partial differential equation is separable.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{align*}
  u_(x,t) &= X(x)T(t) \\
  \pdiff{}{t}(X(x)T(t)) &= 8\pdiff{^2}{x^2}(X(x)T(t)) \\
  X(x)\pdiff{}{t}T(t) &= 8\pdiff{^2}{x^2}(X(x))T(t) \\
  X(x)T'(t) &= 8X''(x)T(t) \\
  \frac{X(x)}{X''(x)} &= \frac{8T'(t)}{T(t)}
\end{align*}
In their separated form, we can set both sides equal to some separation constant
to solve two ordinary differential equations.
\[ \frac{X(x)}{X''(x)} = \frac{8T'(t)}{T(t)} = -\lambda \]
